# GridSystem
Anthill sim(in development)

The idea is to create a simple AI from scratch
 
Pre Programmed behaviour:

*Each ant leaves a trail of pheromones, depending if it is looking for food, or taking 
food back

*Couple of tactics, like follow certain vector depending on circumstances
 
Setup:
Ants should be searching for food on a grid system and take it back to the Anthill,
while eating when hungry
Goal is to find the best way to get the food as a group no matter where it is located 
by training and getting data for tactics
